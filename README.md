[ParcelBright](https://www.parcelbright.com/) is a one stop parcel delivery
solution for businesses of all sizes.

Besides the processing suite linked above, we also provide an
[API](http://developer.parcelbright.com/) for custom integrations to our
platform.

This repository provides documentation on how to integrate with our API and also
how to use the several available endpoints.

## Documentation


### Create a ParcelBright sandbox account

In order to do an integration, you will need to create a test account in our
sandbox environment.

The [Get Started](GetStarted.md) document described in detail how to create
such an account.

### Get familiarised with the API structure and contraints

The [Overview](Overview.md) document describes the design details of our API,
providing information about how to use it.

Where possible, it show examples of the scenarios described in order to make it
easier to understand.

### API Documentation

The last step is to do an integration with our API. The [API](API.md) document
will detail the several endpoints available and how to access them.
